# Overview

Python-based toolbox that allows the automated tracing of bare DNA and nucleo-protein complexes (for example mono-nucleosomes) in AFM images.
Structural parameters such as DNA length, end-to-end distances, nucleosome core particle volume, wrapped length and opening angles can be
quantified. A detailed description of the functionality together with some examples and an installation guide can be found in the
User_guide.docx.

# Repo Contents

- Classes and functions necessary to run the tracing
- Extended Installation / User Guide (User_guide.docx)
- Example AFM image containing bare DNA and mono-nucleosomes

# System Requirements

The Python code was developed and tested on a Windows 10 Education Version 1803 system. In principle, it should run on every system that
is capable of running Python 3.x and installing the required Python packages as specified in the Installation Guide.

# Installation Guide

For a detailed installation guide including how to install Python and setting up the automated tracing please use the User_guide.docx
provided in the repository.

# Demo

Can be found in the User_guide.docx. After setting up the automated tracing from this repository, the example image can be traced to test
the functionality of the software as explained in more detail in the User_guide.docx.
